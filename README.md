# WtDesigner

(Download Windows Binaries (64-bits))[]

**IMPORTANT:**

* Install "vcredist_x64.exe" before running WtDesigner for the first time.
* Run WtDesigner with Administrator rights in Windows.

## What

A WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) front-end editor which serves as bride between HTML/CSS and the (Wt C++ library)[http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt]. It helps create web applications using C++ and the Wt library with just a few clicks. It also simplifies the usage of the Wt library by auto generating most of the boilerplate code and previewing the graphics of the end result without having to compile any C++ code.

## Why

Although C++ doesn’t come into mind as the first language for web development, there is a specific number of scenarios in which it can be advantageous  with respect to other languages:


* High performance, resource demanding web applications.
* Low footprint web GUIs for embedded devices.
* Integrating with existing C++ libraries.
* Porting C++ desktop applications into the web.
* Leveraging existing C++ skill sets for web development.


The (Wt (web toolkit) C++ library)[http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt] is the perfect tool to achieve all the previous goals. Wt simplifies developing web applications by using the well-tested widget-centric design patterns of desktop GUI development and an API inspired by the successful (Qt C++ library)[http://www.qt.io]. 


As a drawback, the widget-centric workflow sacrifices the full graphical potential of HTML/CSS frameworks. It makes it very easy to create simple working web applications, but very complicated to create a beautiful, responsive, personalized, eye-catching designs. 


WtDesigner was created as an attempt to reduce the complexity of creating beautiful web application designs using the Wt library.

***

## How

WtDesigner is a tool which is also inspired by (Qt)[http://www.qt.io] (specifically QtDesigner), and it is based on the Wt library and Qt itself. It provides an easy way to develop the front-end of the web application by means of drag-and-drop elements, blocks and templates. Furthermore, it allows to preview the looks of the application, tweak it and see the results instantly without having to recompile your application.


WtDesigner can be used as a stand-alone application in Windows (and soon Linux and Mac) but it also integrates into your workflow by means of popular IDE plugins.
